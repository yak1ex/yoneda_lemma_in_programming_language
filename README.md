# Yoneda's Lemma in Programming Languages

Please NOTE that I, the author of this repository, am **just a beginner of category theory and Scala and just a listener of the lecture series below** so that it might contain many misunderstandings and errors. **The original author of the material is not responsible for and not related with this repository**.

This repository is inspired by a material ["Yoneda's lemma in Scala"](https://www.slideshare.net/100005930379759/scala-scala) for [a lecture series of category theory](https://chatwork.connpass.com/event/196423/). Actually, one in Scala is just an excerpt from the material with slight modification. The material explains what is implication by Yoneda's lemma if Scala is considered as category.

I tried to express them in other programming languages. Currently, the following languages are implemented.

- Scala: Original implementation extracted from the material, which is **NOT** produced by me.
- C++: It might be ugly and not straightforward in the language but implemented similar effects anyway. C++20 version uses concepts.
- Coq: I am a beginner of Coq, also. Just for me, I felt I could implement them relatively straightforward way. The proofs of the results are not completed.
